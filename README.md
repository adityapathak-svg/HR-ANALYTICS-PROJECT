# HR-ANALYTICS-PROJECT

"This HR Analytics Dashboard was created to analyze key HR metrics for effective decision-making. The dashboard leverages PivotTables and graphical representations to provide insights on employee trends, attrition, and employee demographics."

--Total Employees "The total number of employees in the organization is displayed. This metric helps to understand the current size and scale of the workforce."

--Attrition "Attrition refers to the number of employees who have left the organization over a given period. It is an important metric to measure employee retention and satisfaction."

--Active Employees "This represents the employees who are still with the organization and actively working. It’s crucial for tracking the workforce’s current strength and understanding the impact of attrition on the overall workforce."

--Attrition Rate "The attrition rate is calculated as the percentage of employees who have left relative to the total number of employees. It helps in understanding the pace at which employees are leaving and the overall health of the company in terms of employee retention."

--Average Age "This metric shows the average age of employees within the company. It can provide insights into the age demographics of the workforce and potential gaps in generational diversity." 

--Visual Analysis Breakdown Now, move on to explain how you've broken down and visualized the data:

--Total Employees by Gender "This chart highlights the gender distribution across the workforce. It helps analyze diversity and identify any gender disparities within the organization."

--Education-Wise Attrition "This visual representation breaks down attrition rates based on employees’ education levels. It can reveal trends like whether employees with higher education tend to leave at a higher rate compared to others."

--Attrition by Job Role "In this section, attrition is analyzed by different job roles. This helps identify if certain job roles are experiencing higher turnover, which can inform targeted retention strategies."

--Department-Wise Attrition "Attrition by department shows where the company is losing employees at a departmental level. This data is crucial for managers to assess whether certain departments need attention or improvements in employee satisfaction."

--Attrition by Age Group "This graph focuses on attrition rates based on different age groups. It can help identify patterns in employee departure trends that could be age-related, such as younger employees leaving for career growth or older employees retiring."

--Attrition by Marital Status "Attrition by marital status provides insights into whether there’s any correlation between personal life factors (like marital status) and employee retention."

--Conclusion and Insights

"From the analysis, it appears that the highest attrition is seen in the Sales department and among employees aged 25-30. This could indicate that the organization might need to focus on retaining younger employees by offering growth opportunities or enhancing work-life balance. Additionally, the gender distribution shows a balanced workforce, but further focus on career development for both genders might help reduce attrition rates."
